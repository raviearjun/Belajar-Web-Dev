      <p>
        The <b> chicken (Gallus domesticus)</b> is a large and round
        short-winged bird, domesticated from the red
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Red_junglefowl">junglefowl</a> of
        Southeast Asia around 8,000 years ago. Most chickens are raised for
        food, providing meat and eggs; others are kept as pets[1] or for
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cockfighting">cockfighting</a>.
        Chickens are common and widespread domestic animals, with a territorial
        population of 26.5 billion as of 2023, and an annual production of more
        than 50 billion birds. A hen bred for laying can produce over 300 eggs
        per year. There are numerous cultural references to chickens in
        folklore, religion, and literature

      placenames such as the Hen and Chicken Islands. <sup>[17]</sup> In older
      sources, and still often in trade and scientific contexts, chickens as a
      species are described as common fowl or domestic fowl. <sup>[18]</sup>

      <p>
        Chickens are relatively large birds, active by day. The body is round,
        the legs are unfeathered in most breeds, and the wings are short.
        <sup>[19]</sup>
        <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Junglefowl">Wild junglefowl</a>
        can fly; chickens and their flight muscles are too heavy to allow them
        to fly more than a short distance.[20] Size and coloration vary widely
        between breeds.<sup>[19]</sup> Newly-hatched chicks of both modern and
        heritage varieties weigh the same, about 37 g (1.3 oz). Modern varieties
        however grow much faster; by day 35 a Ross 708 broiler may weigh 1.8 kg
        (4.0 lb) as against the 1.05 kg (2.3 lb) of a heritage chicken of the
        same age.[21]
      </p>
      <p>
        Adult chickens of both sexes have a fleshy crest on their heads called a
        comb or cockscomb, and hanging flaps of skin on either side under their
        beaks called wattles; combs and wattles are more prominent in males.
        Some breeds have a mutation that causes extra feathering under the face,
        giving the appearance of a beard. <sup>[22]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Chickens are omnivores. <sup>[23]</sup>In the wild, they scratch at the
        soil to search for seeds, insects, and animals as large as lizards,
        small snakes,<sup>[24]</sup> and young mice.<sup>[25]</sup> A chicken
        may live for 5â€“10 years, depending on the breed.<sup>[26]</sup> The
        world's oldest known chicken lived for 16 years.<sup>[27]</sup>
      </p>
      <p>
        Chickens are gregarious, living in flocks, and incubate eggs and raise
        young communally. Individual chickens dominate others, establishing a
        pecking order; dominant individuals take priority for access to food and
        nest sites. The concept of dominance, involving pecking, was described
        in female chickens by Thorleif Schjelderup-Ebbe in 1921 as the "pecking
        order".[28][29] Male chickens tend to leap and use their claws in
        conflicts.[30] Chickens are capable of mobbing and killing a weak or
        inexperienced predator, such as a young fox.<sup>[31]</sup>

        A male's crowing is a loud and sometimes shrill call, serving as a
        territorial signal to other males,<sup>[32]</sup> and in response to
        sudden disturbances within their surroundings. Hens cluck loudly after
        laying an egg and to call their chicks. Chickens give different warning
        calls to indicate that a predator is approaching from the air or on the
        ground.<sup>[33]</sup>

      <h2>Reproduction and Life Cycle</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        To initiate courting, some roosters may dance in a circle around or near
        a hen (a circle dance), often lowering the wing which is closest to the
        hen.
        <sup
          ><a href="https://archive.org/details/animalsintransla00gran/page/69"
            >[34]</a

        The dance triggers a response in the hen
        <sup
          ><a href="https://archive.org/details/animalsintransla00gran/page/69"
            >[34]</a
          ></sup
        >
        and when she responds to his call, the rooster may mount the hen and
        proceed with the mating. Mating typically involves a sequence in which
        the male approaches the female and performs a waltzing display. If the
        female is unreceptive, she runs off; otherwise, she crouches, and the
        male mounts, treading with both feet on her back. After copulation the
        male does a tail-bending display.

        Sperm transfer occurs by cloacal contact between the male and female, in
        an action called the 'cloacal kiss'.

        Reproductive hormones including estrogen, progesterone, and
        gonadotropins (luteinizing hormone and follicle-stimulating hormone)
        initiate and maintain sexual maturation changes. Reproduction declines
        with age, thought to be due to a decline in GnRH-I-N.

        Newly hatched chicks Hens often try to lay in nests that already contain
        eggs and sometimes move eggs from neighbouring nests into their own. A
        flock thus uses only a few preferred locations, rather than having a
        different nest for every bird.

        Under natural conditions, most birds lay only until a clutch is
        complete; they then incubate all the eggs. This is called "going
        broody". The hen sits on the nest, fluffing up or pecking defensively if
        disturbed. She rarely leaves the nest until the eggs have hatched.

        Eggs of chickens from the high-altitude region of Tibet have special
        physiological adaptations that result in a higher hatching rate in low
        oxygen environments. When eggs are placed in a hypoxic environment,
        chicken embryos from these populations express much more hemoglobin than
        embryos from other chicken populations. This hemoglobin has a greater
        affinity for oxygen, binding oxygen more readily.

        Fertile chicken eggs hatch at the end of the incubation period, about 21
        days; the chick uses its egg tooth to break out of the shell.

        Hens remain on the nest for about two days after the first chick
        hatches; during this time the newly hatched chicks feed by absorbing the
        internal yolk sac.

        The hen guards her chicks and broods them to keep them warm. She leads
        them to food and water and calls them towards food. The chicks imprint
        on the hen and subsequently follow her continually. She continues to
        care for them until they are several weeks old.

      <h2>Origin</h2>
      <hr />
      <h3>Phylogeny</h3>
      <p>
        Water or ground-dwelling fowl similar to modern partridges, in the
        Galliformes, the order of bird that chickens belong to, survived the
        Cretaceousâ€“Paleogene extinction event that killed all tree-dwelling
        birds and their dinosaur relatives. <sup>[46]</sup> Chickens are
        descended primarily from the red junglefowl (Gallus gallus) and are
        scientifically classified as the same species.
        <sup>[47]</sup> Domesticated chickens freely interbreed with populations
        of red junglefowl. <sup>[47]</sup> The domestic chicken has subsequently
        hybridised with grey junglefowl, Sri Lankan junglefowl and green
        junglefowl;<sup>[48]</sup> a gene for yellow skin, for instance, was
        incorporated into domestic birds from the grey junglefowl (G.
        sonneratii). <sup>[49]</sup> It is estimated that chickens share between
        71 and 79% of their genome with red junglefowl. <sup>[48]</sup>
      </p>
      <h3>Domestication</h3>
      <p>
        According to one early study, a single domestication event of the red
        junglefowl in present-day Thailand gave rise to the modern chicken with
        minor transitions separating the modern breeds. <sup>[52]</sup> The red
        junglefowl is well adapted to take advantage of the vast quantities of
        seed produced during the end of the multi-decade bamboo seeding cycle,
        to boost its own reproduction.<sup>[53]</sup> In domesticating the
        chicken, humans took advantage of the red junglefowl's ability to
        reproduce prolifically when exposed to a surge in its food supply.
        <sup>[54]</sup> Exactly when and where the chicken was domesticated
        remains controversial. Genomic studies estimate that the chicken was
        domesticated 8,000 years ago<sup>[48]</sup> in Southeast Asia and spread
        to China and India 2,000 to 3,000 years later. Archaeological evidence
        supports domestic chickens in Southeast Asia well before 6000 BC, China
        by 6000 BC and India by 2000 BC.<sup>[48]</sup><sup>[55]</sup
        ><sup>[56]</sup> A landmark 2020 Nature study that fully sequenced 863
        chickens across the world suggests that all domestic chickens originate
        from a single domestication event of red junglefowl whose present-day
        distribution is predominantly in southwestern China, northern Thailand
        and Myanmar. These domesticated chickens spread across Southeast and
        South Asia where they interbred with local wild species of junglefowl,
        forming genetically and geographically distinct groups. Analysis of the
        most popular commercial breed shows that the White Leghorn breed
        possesses a mosaic of divergent ancestries inherited from subspecies of
        red junglefowl.<sup>[57]</sup><sup>[58]</sup><sup>[59]</sup>
